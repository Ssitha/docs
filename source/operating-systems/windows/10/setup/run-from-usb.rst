`Run Windows 10 From USB`_
##########################
Download the `WinToUSB`_ tool and install. If not registering, use a Windows 10
ISO that is one version behind the current version (can update after running
it).

#. Select the windows ISO to use.
#. Set appropriate Windows 10 version for your hardware license.
#. Set :cmdmenu:`GPT for UEFI`.
#. Create disk. This will take a few minutes as Windows 10 is actually being
   installed to the USB drive.

Once done, just select the :cmdmenu:`Windows Boot Manager` label for the USB
disk to boot into a clean Windows 10 install.
