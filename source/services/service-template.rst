Service Templates
#################
There are no blank service templates. Good examples are below (and all are based
off of these).

* :ref:`service-deluge` is a good docker reference using two separate references
  for proxy configuration.
* :ref:`service-radarr` is a good docker reference with a complex configuration
  GUI setup, as well as single reference for both proxy configurations.
* :ref:`service-mumble` is a good traditional service setup reference.
