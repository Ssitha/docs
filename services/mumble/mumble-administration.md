Mumble Server Administration
----------------------------

Adding New Member
-----------------
 * `Right-Click user > Register`
 * User should now appear with a + icon: ![User+](images/new-member-01.png)
 * `Right-Click root channel > select Edit`

   ![edit channel](images/new-member-02.png)

 * Select Groups tab (1), then select from the pulldown (2). Type in the
   userâ€™s name (should autopopulate) (3). Click add (4) and OK (5):

   ![add user](images/new-member-03.png)

 * User should now be able to move into all properly created channels

Create New Channel
------------------
 * `Right-Click root channel > Add`

   ![add channel](images/create-channel-01.png)

 * Type channel name, leave everything else alone:

   ![channel name](images/create-channel-02.png)

 * All permissions are inherited from the root channel, so as long as the user
   is added to the group, they have access to all channels created in that
   channel
