2990WX Linux Patches
--------------------
Until [Kernel 4.18.6 is released with the k10temp patch][1], Threadripper
thermals will be mis-reported by 27c. Building a custom Kernel module will fix
the issue temporarily.

This specifically patches thermal detection for the [Gigabyte X399 Aorus
Extreme][2] for Ubuntu, but most likely will easily translate to other distros
and motherboards.

### Install Build Tools
1. Add `deb-src` lines for sources in `/etc/apt`.

```bash
apt update && apt upgrade
apt install build-essential bison flex linux-headers lm-sensors
```

### Install all Kernel Dependencies
This will allow you to build against the current kernel.

```bash
apt build-dep linux
```

### Clone patched IT87 Kernel Driver
The original kernel IT87 driver was removed by the original author when he
couldn't keep up with requests anymore. Pull from a [clone of that
repository][3] with the AMD patches built in.

This will build and install the module for your current kernel.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rpavlik/it87
cd it87
make clean
make
make install
```
* https://github.com/Road-Drum/it87 contains a unmodified fork of original it87.

### Force Detection of Module
Both the [IT8792E and IT8795E][5] have the same ID, so we need to force module
installation and ignore conflicts.

```bash
modprobe it87 ignore_resource_conflict=1
```

Scan for new sensors and then show current values
```bash
sensors-detect
sensors | grep -i amd
```
* `sensors-detect` can be run with all default values.
* See [Reading Sensors](#reading-sensors) for a breakdown of sensors for the
  X399 Aorus board.
* If a line is returned, then you are correctly reading Threadripper thermal
  temperatures.

### Load Module on Boot
Add the module load line for ramfs and update it.

vim `/etc/initramfs/modules`
```
it87 ignore_resource_conflict=1
```

```bash
sudo update-initramfs -u
```
* Any new kernel installed will require a new build of this module.

Reading sensors
---------------
Be sure to read the correct chipset to find the right sensor values. Labels are
according to the [board layout diagram][4].

```bash
sensors
```

Building Kernel 4.18.6+
-----------------------
If you would rather [install a later Kernel][1], be aware that this will not be
auto upgraded, and you'll need to install additional packages for kernel support
such as ZFS (e.g. zfs-dkms spl-dkms). These are essentially Vanilla kernels for
Ubuntu with core patches. You will need _at least_ Kernel **4.18.6**.

### Download [Kernel 4.18.6][6]
Determine your platform. Any recent 64bit CPU will be **amd64**. You _only_ need
the generic kernel.

```bash
wget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.18.6/linux-headers-4.18.6-041806_4.18.6-041806.201809050847_all.deb
wget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.18.6/linux-headers-4.18.6-041806-generic_4.18.6-041806.201809050847_amd64.deb
wget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.18.6/linux-image-unsigned-4.18.6-041806-generic_4.18.6-041806.201809050847_amd64.deb
wget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.18.6/linux-modules-4.18.6-041806-generic_4.18.6-041806.201809050847_amd64.deb
```

Then install packages in the following order and reboot into the new Kernel.
```bash
dpkg -i linux-headers*all.deb
dpkg -i linux-headers*amd64.deb
dpkg -i linux-modules*amd64.deb
dpkg -i linux-image*amd64.deb
```

### Load k10temp module
Load the updated Kernel module to detect temperature. Add to ramfs if it is not
already loaded on boot.

```bash
modprobe k10temp
```

vim `/etc/initramfs/modules`
```
k10temp
```

```bash
sudo update-initramfs -u
```
